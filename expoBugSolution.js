Debugging this type of error requires a systematic approach. Here are some steps to take:

1. **Check the Expo CLI version:** Ensure you have the latest version installed using `expo --version` and update if necessary using `npm install -g expo-cli@latest`.
2. **Verify Project Dependencies:**  Carefully review your `package.json` and make sure all dependencies are compatible with your Expo SDK version. Check for any conflicting or outdated packages. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure everything is properly installed.
3. **Clean the project:** Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `.expo` folder, then reinstalling dependencies.  This can resolve issues caused by corrupted package files.  
4. **Check your Expo config:** Review your `app.json` and `app.config.js` files for any misconfigurations, typos or invalid values. Pay close attention to your `expo.ios` and `expo.android` settings. 
5. **Examine the Full Error Message:** Carefully read the complete error message, including any stack traces. The error message may hint at the cause, even if it's not entirely clear.  Look for clues about file paths, specific functions or modules involved.  
6. **Examine the Log Files:** Expo may write to log files during the build or start process. Check the log files for more detailed information. 
7. **Simplify the project:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. Start with a new Expo project, gradually adding components and dependencies until the error reappears. This helps to identify the specific component or dependency causing the issue. 
8. **Search online:** Search for the specific error message or parts of the message on sites like Stack Overflow or the Expo forums.  Someone might have encountered a similar issue.
9. **Check Expo forums and documentation:** The Expo documentation and community forums are valuable resources for troubleshooting common and uncommon Expo issues.
